Limitations and Surprises

Templating
==========

Before templates are passed to Jinja or Cheetah there is a pre-processing of templates happening. During pre-processing
Cobbler replaces variables like ``@@my_key@@`` in the template. Those keys are currently limited by the regex of ``\S``,
which translates to ``[^ \t\n\r\f\v]``.

Restarting the daemon
=====================

Once you have a Cobbler distro imported or manually added you have to make sure the source for the Kernel & initrd is
available all the time. Thus I highly recommend you to add the ISOs to your ``/etc/fstab`` to make them persistent
across reboots. If you forget to remount them the Cobbler daemon won't start!

Kernel options
==============

The user (so you) is responsible for generating the correct quoting of the Kernel Command Line. We manipulate the
arguments you give us in a way that we add wrapping double quotes around them when the value contains a space.

The Linux Kernel describes its quoting at:
`The kernelâ€™s command-line parameters <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.15/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html#the-kernel-s-command-line-parameters>`_

Please consult the documentation of your operating system for how it deals with this if it is not Linux.
